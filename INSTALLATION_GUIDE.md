## Step 3: Launch DontSleep

2. Look for the DontSleep icon in your menu bar (üåô or ‚òÄÔ∏è)
3. Click the icon to toggle sleep prevention

## ‚ùì **Why This Security Warning?**

- DontSleep is **completely safe** - all source code is public
- The warning appears because we're not paying Apple $99/year for a certificate
- This is **normal for open-source apps**
- Once you bypass it once, it never appears again

## üÜò **Still Having Issues?**

1. **App won't open after fix:**
   ```bash
   # Check if it has the quarantine attribute
   xattr -l /Applications/DontSleep.app
   
   # If you see com.apple.quarantine, remove it
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DontSleep.app
   ```

2. **No menu bar icon:**
   - Check if the app is actually running: `ps aux | grep DontSleep`
   - Try quitting and reopening the app

3. **Permission issues:**
   - Make sure you have admin rights on your Mac
   - Try using `sudo` with the command

4. **Other problems:**
   - [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/DontSleep/issues)
   - Include your macOS version and what you tried

## üí° **Pro Tips**

- **One-time process:** Once you fix the security warning, it's fixed forever
- **Source code review:** You can verify the app's safety by checking the code on GitHub
- **Alternative:** Build from source if you're comfortable with development tools
