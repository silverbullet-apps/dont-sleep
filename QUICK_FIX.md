xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DontSleep.app

# Now open it normally
open /Applications/DontSleep.app
```

### Option 2: Right-Click Method (Sometimes Works)

2. Select **"Open"** from the menu
3. Click **"Open"** when asked
4. Done! App will work normally forever

### Option 3: Automated Script
```bash
# Navigate to where the app is located
cd /Applications  # or wherever you put DontSleep.app

# Remove the quarantine
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine DontSleep.app

# Now open it normally
open DontSleep.app
```
