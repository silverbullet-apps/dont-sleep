# üîê macOS Security Warning - DontSleep App

## What is this warning?

When you download and try to run DontSleep on macOS, you might see a security warning like:

> **"DontSleep.app" Not Opened**  
> Apple could not verify "DontSleep.app" is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

**This is normal and expected!** This warning appears because:
- DontSleep is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate
- It's not distributed through the Mac App Store
- macOS Gatekeeper is protecting your system (which is good!)

## üöÄ How to Open DontSleep (Users)

### Method 1: Right-Click Method (Recommended)
1. **Right-click** on the DontSleep app
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
4. The app will now run and be trusted for future use

### Method 2: System Preferences
1. Go to **System Preferences** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy** ‚Üí **General**
2. Look for a message about DontSleep being blocked
3. Click **"Open Anyway"**
4. Enter your password when prompted

### Method 3: Automated Fix Script
```bash
# Download and run the fix script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/DontSleep/main/fix-security-warning.sh
chmod +x fix-security-warning.sh
./fix-security-warning.sh
```

### Method 4: Terminal (Advanced Users)
```bash
# Navigate to where DontSleep.app is located
cd /Applications  # or wherever you put the app

# Remove the quarantine attribute
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine DontSleep.app

# Now you can open it normally
open DontSleep.app
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Is DontSleep Safe?

**Yes, DontSleep is safe to use!** 

- ‚úÖ The source code is completely open and available on GitHub
- ‚úÖ You can review every line of code before running it
- ‚úÖ It only prevents your Mac from sleeping - no network access or data collection
- ‚úÖ No malware, adware, or suspicious behavior
- ‚úÖ Built with standard Apple development tools (Xcode + Swift)

The warning appears because we're an independent developer, not because the app is dangerous.

## üîß For Developers: Preventing This Warning

### Option 1: Ad-hoc Code Signing (Free)
The updated build script now includes ad-hoc code signing:

```bash
# This is now included in build-and-package.sh
codesign --force --deep --sign - DontSleep.app
```

This reduces (but doesn't eliminate) the security warnings.

### Option 2: Developer ID Signing ($99/year)
For commercial distribution without warnings:

1. **Join Apple Developer Program** ($99/year)
2. **Get a Developer ID certificate**
3. **Sign the app with your certificate:**
   ```bash
   codesign --force --deep --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name" DontSleep.app
   ```
4. **Notarize the app** (optional but recommended)

### Option 3: Mac App Store Distribution
- No security warnings
- Requires Apple Developer Program membership
- Must follow App Store guidelines
